# 3d Printer

## Summary

I am fascinated by the notion of printing three-dimensional things. I think it gives you an awesome power to print anything you want! Personally, I've built a few hardware projects before like a bluetooth remote-controlled car and a finger-print system with my friends and it is quite different from building a software or a website. This is why I am really excited to build a 3d Printer!

## Plan

Currently, I am researching various tutorials on the internet and seeing if it is possible to actually build one under $250. I am reading through various articles, tutorials and I'm watching a ton of YouTube videos! I won't lie, those tutorials are quite intimidating but my plan is simple: find an awesome article or a blog and follow it till the end.
